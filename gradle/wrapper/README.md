# Gradle Wrapper Setup

The gradle-wrapper.jar file is needed to build this project but is not included in the repository.

To set up the Gradle wrapper:

1. Install Gradle on your system
2. Run: `gradle wrapper` in the project root
3. This will download and set up the Gradle wrapper

Alternatively, if you have Android Studio:
1. Open the project in Android Studio
2. Android Studio will automatically download the Gradle wrapper

The wrapper will be downloaded to: gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar
